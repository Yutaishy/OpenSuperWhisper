# GitHub Release Preparation Summary

## Date: 2025-08-03

This document summarizes the directory cleanup and preparation performed for GitHub release.

## 🎯 Objectives Completed

### 1. Directory Structure Organization ✅
- Created comprehensive `.gitignore` file
- Moved all development/test files to `archive/` directory
- Organized project structure for third-party usage

### 2. Archive Organization ✅
The following items were moved to the `archive/` directory:
- **Test Files**: 16 development test scripts moved to `archive/test_files/`
- **Old Logs**: Previous log files moved to `archive/old_logs/`
- **NPM Cache**: Cached npm files moved to `archive/npm_cache/`
- **Dev Reports**: Development reports moved to `archive/dev_reports/`
- **Current Logs**: Active log file temporarily in `archive/current_logs/`

### 3. Documentation Updates ✅
- **README.md**: 
  - Added Real-time Transcription features section
  - Fixed social preview image path
  - Updated to v0.6.13 features
- **Project Documentation**: 
  - Updated `.claude/docs/DIRECTORY_STRUCTURE.md`
  - Maintained all troubleshooting and development guides

### 4. Core Project Structure ✅

## 📋 Pre-Release Checklist

Before creating a GitHub release, ensure:

- [ ] All tests pass: `pytest tests/ -v`
- [ ] Version number updated in all relevant files
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md updated with latest changes
- [ ] README.md reflects current features
- [ ] No sensitive information in codebase (API keys, etc.)
- [ ] License file is present and correct
- [ ] Build scripts tested on all platforms

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Test Final Structure**: Run the application to ensure nothing was broken during cleanup
2. **Create Release Build**: Use `build_executable.py` for platform builds
3. **Tag Release**: Create git tag for the version
4. **GitHub Release**: Upload builds and create release notes

## 📁 Files Safe to Delete

The following can be safely deleted if needed:
- `archive/` directory (contains only development artifacts)
- `logs/` directory (recreated automatically)
- Any `__pycache__` directories
- `.pytest_cache/` directory

## 🎨 Release Assets

Ensure these are included in the release:
- Platform-specific executables (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- README.md as release description base
- CHANGELOG.md for detailed changes
- Sample style guides from `style_guides/`

## ✨ Final Notes

The project is now organized for professional third-party release. The directory structure is clean, documentation is comprehensive, and all development artifacts are properly archived.

Key improvements in v0.6.13:
- Real-time transcription with chunk-based processing
- Long recording support (10+ minutes)
- Thread-safe GUI operations
- Comprehensive error handling
- Memory-efficient processing

The codebase is ready for public release on GitHub.
