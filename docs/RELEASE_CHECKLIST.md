- Watch "Release" workflow progress
- Verify all platform builds succeed
- Check that artifacts are uploaded

### 3. Verify GitHub Release
- Go to [Releases page](https://github.com/Yutaishy/OpenSuperWhisper/releases)
- Confirm release is created with correct tag
- Verify all platform downloads are present:
  - `windows-x64.zip` + `.sha256`
  - `macos-arm64.dmg` + `.sha256`
  - `macos-x64.dmg` + `.sha256`
  - `linux-x64.tar.gz` + `.sha256`
  - SBOM files for each platform

### 4. Post-Release Testing
- [ ] Download each platform archive
- [ ] Verify SHA256 checksums match
- [ ] Test installation on clean VMs if available
- [ ] Confirm Discord notification was sent (if configured)

## Platform-Specific Verification

### Windows
- [ ] Download `windows-x64.zip`
- [ ] Extract to test directory
- [ ] Run `OpenSuperWhisper.exe`
- [ ] Verify no antivirus warnings (or document if present)
- [ ] Test with Windows Defender enabled

### macOS
- [ ] Download appropriate DMG (ARM64 or x64)
- [ ] Mount DMG
- [ ] Drag to Applications
- [ ] First launch: Right-click â†’ Open
- [ ] Grant microphone and accessibility permissions
- [ ] Verify notarization: `spctl -a -vv /Applications/OpenSuperWhisper.app`

### Linux
- [ ] Download `linux-x64.tar.gz`
- [ ] Extract: `tar -xzf linux-x64.tar.gz`
- [ ] Install dependencies: `sudo apt-get install libportaudio2`
- [ ] Run: `./OpenSuperWhisper/OpenSuperWhisper`
- [ ] Verify audio recording works

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures
1. Check workflow logs for specific error
2. Verify all secrets are configured correctly
3. Ensure dependencies haven't changed
4. Test locally with same Python version

### Signing Issues
- **Windows**: Certificate may be expired or invalid
- **macOS**: Check Apple Developer account status
- **Both**: Signing is optional, builds work without it

### Release Not Created
1. Verify tag format matches `v*.*.*`
2. Check permissions for GITHUB_TOKEN
3. Ensure workflow has write access to releases

### Missing Artifacts
1. Check individual build job logs
2. Verify artifact upload steps completed
3. Check for disk space issues in runners

## Rollback Procedure

If critical issues are found post-release:

1. **Mark as Pre-release**:
   - Edit release on GitHub
   - Check "This is a pre-release"
   - Save changes

2. **Create Hotfix**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/v0.6.15.1
   # Make fixes
   git commit -m "Fix: <description>"
   git push origin hotfix/v0.6.15.1
   ```

3. **New Release**:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge hotfix/v0.6.15.1
   git tag -a v0.6.15.1 -m "Hotfix release"
   git push origin v0.6.15.1
   ```

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- Never commit API keys or certificates
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Document which secrets are required

### Code Signing Status
- **Windows**: Optional, reduces SmartScreen warnings
- **macOS**: Recommended for distribution
- **Linux**: SHA256 checksums provided

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Dependabot alerts enabled
- Regular dependency updates
- SBOM included for supply chain visibility
